**Security**

- Encrypted preferences, your API key and other addy.io related settings are securely stored on your device using
  the [Keychain API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/)
- No stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (Except for Google Play Store builds). So if you get a crash, please share the crash
  info with me >_<.
- I am forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence.  **What's yours is yours**.

 > Manage (add, edit, delete)

- Aliases
- Recipients
- Domains
- Usernames
- Rules
- Failed deliveries
