üöÄ **Launch Day!** - We've blasted off into the iOS universe with addy.io app for iOS and iPadOS!

- **Core Functionality Unleashed**: 
  - Organize your aliases, domains, recipients, rules and more like a pro...
  - Enjoy app exclusive features such as watching aliases, Siri and Shortcuts integration and many, many more!

- **Design & Aesthetics**: 
  - Feast your eyes on our minimalist design. Because who needs clutter when you have clean lines and a splash of color?
  - Dark mode for those nocturnal productivity bursts or just because it looks cool.

- **User Experience**: 
  - Swipe, tap, and maybe even double-tap (just for fun) your way through the addy.io app. It's like dancing, but with less chance of stepping on someone's toes.
  
- **Privacy & Security**: 
  - Your data is more secure than your grandma's secret cookie recipe. We've got the locks, the bolts, and the digital dogs guarding your info.

- **Bugs**: 
  - We've squashed some, but let's be real, some might still be lurking. Report them, and we'll turn them into features... or at least fix them.

- **Future Promises**: 
  - This is just the beginning. Expect updates, enhancements, and maybe even a feature you didn't know you needed but can't live without.

**Thank you for joining us on this journey!** Let's make organizing life's little details not just bearable, but actually kind of fun. 

Stay tuned, stay organized, and keep those addy.io vibes alive! üåü
