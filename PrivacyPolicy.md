The Privacy Policy respects and protects the individual privacy of all users of the Privacy Policy Web Services.
In order to provide you with a more accurate and personalized service, my Privacy Policy covers the ways in which I collect, use, disclose, transmit and store your information.
However, the Privacy Policy will treat this information with a high degree of diligence and duty of care. I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
By agreeing to the Privacy Policy Network Services Usage Agreement, you agree to this Privacy Policy in its entirety.
This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Privacy Policy Network Service Use Agreement.
You do not have to provide me with the personal information I request, but in many cases, if you choose not to do so, I will not be able to provide you with my products or services or respond to any questions you may have.

<h3> I. How I collect information</h3>
I don't actively collect information at all. Even without your information, I'm still running just fine. Of course, if it crashes, you have the option of sending me an email with the device model and system version information so that I can locate the problem.

<h3> II. How I use the information I collect</h3>
I don't collect information voluntarily at all. But if, after a crash, you voluntarily send me information about your device, I will use it to locate and resolve your crash, not for any other purpose.

<h3> III. how I share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information</h3>
I don't actively collect information at all. And no personal information about you, so don't worry.
But if, after a crash, you actively send me information about your device, I'll use it for nothing more than locating and resolving your crash (which may appear in Git commits, logs, or Github-related issues).

<h3>IV. How to contact me</h3>
